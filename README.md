## AnyConvert 1.0 ##AnyConvert 1.0
Currently supports only mp4 to webp conversion, but it will change soon!

About AnyConvert 1.0
AnyConvert 1.0 is simple way to convert .mp4 files into .webp files from windows context menu. Using the program is incredibly easy - install -> option "Convert to WebP" appears in your context menu after right-clicking on .mp4 file -> click the option -> file is converted!

Code-side
AnyConvert 1.0 uses ffmpeg to convert files. It needs ffmpeg folder to work properly. Folder should be stored in same directory as .exe of programme.

Future plans
I will update the program, to add more useful options. Starting with other video file convertions, ending on pdf flattening, this would be all-in-one application for home office.
