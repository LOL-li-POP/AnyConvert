## AnyConvert 1.0 ##
Currently supports only mp4 to webp conversion, but it will change soon!

**About AnyConvert 1.0**

AnyConvert 1.0 is simple way to convert .mp4 files into .webp files from windows context menu. Using the program is incredibly easy - install -> option "Convert to WebP" appears in your context menu after right-clicking on .mp4 file -> click the option -> file is converted!

**How to make it working**

Easiest method is to download .exe installer, but if you want to have all files on your machine here are the steps:
1. download repo files
2. install reg.reg
3. add ffmpeg folder to the same directory as anyConvert.exe
4. Done!

**Code-side**

AnyConvert 1.0 uses ffmpeg to convert files. It needs ffmpeg folder to work properly. Folder should be stored in same directory as .exe of programme.

**Future plans**

I will update the program, to add more useful options. Starting with other video file convertions, ending on pdf flattening, this would be all-in-one application for home office.
